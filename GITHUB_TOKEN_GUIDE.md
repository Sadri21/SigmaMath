# How to Get Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Since you have multiple accounts, we need a specific "password" for **Sadri21** to allow this computer to upload files to that account safely.

1.  **Log in to GitHub** as **Sadri21**.
2.  Go to **Settings** (Click your profile picture in the top right > Settings).
3.  Scroll down to the bottom of the left sidebar and click **Developer settings**.
4.  Click **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
5.  Click **Generate new token** > **Generate new token (classic)**.
6.  **Note**: "Upload for SigmaMath".
7.  **Expiration**: Set to "No expiration" (or 90 days if you prefer).
8.  **Select scopes**: Check the box for **repo** (Full control of private repositories).
9.  Scroll down and click **Generate token**.
10. **COPY THE TOKEN**. It starts with `ghp_...`. You won't see it again!

**Next Step:**
I will ask you to run a command. When it asks for a **Password**, paste this token!
